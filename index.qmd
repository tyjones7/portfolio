## Welcome

This portfolio showcases my journey into product management—from hands-on projects I've built to the real-world problems I'm passionate about solving. I'm a strategic thinker who loves turning complex challenges into simple, user-centered solutions.

Here you'll find my featured projects, the friction points I'm actively exploring, and my background in analytics, operations, and digital product development. Whether you're a potential collaborator, employer, or fellow builder, I hope this gives you a sense of how I think and what I bring to the table.
