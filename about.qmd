## Background

I'm a product-minded strategist studying at Brigham Young University, where I'm pursuing a degree in Strategic Management with a focus on Product Management. My path here wasn't traditional—I've worn hats as a digital marketer, operations lead, and sales rep, each role sharpening my ability to understand users, optimize processes, and drive measurable results.

What draws me to product management is the intersection of empathy and execution. I love digging into why something isn't working, mapping out the friction, and building solutions that actually stick. Whether it's analyzing campaign metrics at the Missionary Training Center or streamlining workflows for a cleaning services company, I've consistently found myself gravitating toward the question: *How can we make this better for the people using it?*

I'm particularly energized by the potential of AI to transform how we build and deliver products. I've been experimenting with LLMs, APIs, and agent development—not just as tools, but as a new paradigm for solving problems that were previously intractable.

### What's Next

I'm seeking product management roles where I can combine my analytical background with my passion for building user-centered solutions. I thrive in environments that value experimentation, move quickly, and aren't afraid to challenge conventional approaches.

Specifically, I'm drawn to opportunities in:

- **AI-native products** – Companies rethinking workflows from the ground up with AI, not just adding it as a feature
- **B2B SaaS** – Solving complex problems for businesses with data-driven, iterative product development
- **Early-stage startups** – Where I can wear multiple hats, learn rapidly, and have direct impact on product direction

If you're building something interesting and think I might be a good fit, I'd love to connect.
